## Magnetic Maps Inclination Prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## Overview
The purpose of this Project is to train a CNN predictor that can predict inclinations of the magnetization of a source body in the subsurface, given a magnetic data map. 

During this project:
* understand the workflow of training a CNN.
* use Keras to train a CNN and make predictions.

## What is inclination?

The Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination (D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (I) or magnetic dip. The intensity (F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet.
